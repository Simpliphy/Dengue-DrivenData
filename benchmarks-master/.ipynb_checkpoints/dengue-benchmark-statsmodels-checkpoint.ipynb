    "Dengue fever is bad. It's real bad. Dengue is a mosquito-borne disease that occurs in tropical and sub-tropical parts of the world. In mild cases, symptoms are similar to the flu: fever, rash and muscle and joint pain. But severe cases are dangerous, and dengue fever can cause severe bleeding, low blood pressure and even death.\n",

    "Because it is carried by mosquitoes, the transmission dynamics of dengue are related to climate variables such as temperature and precipitation. Although the relationship to climate is complex, a growing number of scientists argue that climate change is likely to produce distributional shifts that will have significant public health implications worldwide.\n",

    "Which techniqe will perform better depends on many things, but the choice between Poisson regression and negative binomial regression is pretty straightforward. Poisson regression fits according to the assumption that the mean and variance of the population distributiona are equal. When they aren't, specifically when the variance is much larger than the mean, the negative binomial approach is better. Why? It isn't magic. The negative binomial regression simply lifts the assumption that the population mean and variance are equal, allowing for a larger class of possible models. In fact, from this perspective, the Poisson distribution is but a special case of the negative binomial distribution.\n",

For example, we see that our model in blue does track the seasonality of Dengue cases. However, the timing of the seasonality of our predictions has a mismatch with the actual results. One potential reason for this is that our features don't look far enough into the past--that is to say, we are asking to predict cases at the same time as we are measuring percipitation. Because dengue is misquito born, and the misquito lifecycle depends on water, we need to take both the life of a misquito and the time between infection and symptoms into account when modeling dengue. This is a critical avenue to explore when improving this model.\n",

    "The other important error is that our predictions are relatively consistent--we miss the spikes that are large outbreaks. One reason is that we don't take into account the contagiousness of dengue. A possible way to account for this is to build a model that progressively predicts a new value while taking into account the previous prediction. By training on the dengue outbreaks and then using the predicted number of patients in the week before, we can start to model this time dependence that the current model misses.\n",
